# Fastapi

This is a quite simple RESTful API made with [Fastify] and uses [MongoDB] as a database that includes a protected endpoint plus login/signup endpoints
Fastify coupled with ES Modules and a Modern JS syntax makes node shine quite nice, one of the best dev experiences you can get out there
